Running this project is very easy:
1. Run all cells in 'source code'.ipynb in order to get the data analysis and classifier evaluations.
2. Read along.

For the Technical report, again all you have to do is run all cells. The required functions and modules will be imported automatically.

    
The notebook is organized into a couple sections; Data Visualizations, Hypothesis tests, and Classifiers. Each section has code interleaved with markdown and as long as you run all cells it is easy to follow along the notebook. 
The utility functions in functions.py are imported into the notebook on the first line and are utilized throughout.
